# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project: Campaign Tracking Analysis Dashboard

### Purpose: To have a flash statistics visual report (dashboard) ready in order to track status of the campaign with fact and figures to meet goals and deadlines.  

## Analysis and Challenges: Provided raw data was not in order, various data types with no standard formats. We had to covert unix dates to US date, target and pledged were not converted in a single currency unit nor currency conversion rates provided in order to do forecast/budgeting in a single currency unit. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date: Most successful month was May and Dec was the most un-successful. Jan was the month of cancellation.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals: Higher the goal seems having most un-successful campaign, sponsors tend to help bit by bit and do not fund costly projects to avoid failure.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results: Overall campaign was 50% successful, get more sponsors with small pledges to achieve goals and so big campaign could be broken into multiple goals per deadlines. 

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset? 
Real time currency conversion rate not available, itâ€™s hard to perform forecasting/budgeting analysis without single currency unit.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We can also provide graphical analysis for parent category for duration of campaign using launch date and end dates of campaign.
